## Predicting Industrial Machine Downtime

These are the files relating to my would-be entry to this [competition](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/competitions/industrial-machine-level-2) on DataCamp. I wrote the
report using R and R Markdown.

The .csv file contains all the data used, whereas the .html file is the final report with the visuals and most of the relevant code. It can be easily downloaded and
viewed in the browser. The .Rmd file is the source material for the notebook and contains in addition some of the more complicated or less useful code.

When viewing the report on the browser, I would advise initially collapsing all chunks from the dropdown menu at the top. Some of the chunks are quite long and
may get in the way of comfortable reading.
